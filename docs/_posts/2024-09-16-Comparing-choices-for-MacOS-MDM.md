Managing macOS devices efficiently is crucial for businesses that rely on Apple hardware. When it comes to Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions, Intune, JAMF, and Kandji stand out as popular choices. Each of these solutions offers distinct features and benefits, catering to various organisational needs. In this blog, we’ll delve into how Intune MDM for macOS compares to JAMF and Kandji, including an important consideration: Microsoft’s new macOS Single Sign-On (SSO) feature.

## Microsoft Intune MDM for macOS

**Overview:**  
Microsoft Intune is part of the Microsoft Endpoint Manager suite, offering comprehensive MDM and mobile application management (MAM) capabilities. It integrates seamlessly with other Microsoft products, making it a natural choice for organisations already invested in the Microsoft ecosystem.

**Pros:**

1. **Integration with Microsoft ecosystem:** For organisations using Office 365, Azure Active Directory, and other Microsoft services, Intune offers excellent integration, providing a unified management experience.
2. **Cross-platform management:** Intune supports not only macOS but also Windows, iOS, and Android, allowing for a unified management approach across diverse device types.
3. **Cloud-based:** Being a cloud-native solution, Intune requires minimal on-premises infrastructure and scales easily with organisational needs.
4. **Security and compliance:** Intune provides robust security features, including conditional access policies, threat protection, and data loss prevention, which are crucial for meeting compliance requirements.

**Cons:**

1. **Limited macOS-specific features:** While Intune covers basic macOS management needs, it may lack some advanced macOS-specific features available in dedicated macOS MDM solutions.
2. **Learning curve:** Users who are not already familiar with Microsoft’s ecosystem might face a steeper learning curve.
3. **Cost:** Depending on the Microsoft licensing model, Intune can be more expensive compared to some other MDM solutions, particularly if additional Microsoft services are not already in use.

**Microsoft macOS SSO integration:**  
A significant advantage of using Intune is its compatibility with Microsoft’s new macOS Single Sign-On (SSO) feature. The SSO integration allows users to authenticate once and gain access to all their cloud applications without needing to re-enter credentials. However, **macOS SSO requires Intune MDM/MAM** to be properly configured. This means that organisations leveraging SSO for seamless authentication will need to deploy Intune for effective management and security of these configurations.

## JAMF Pro

**Overview:**  
JAMF Pro is a leading MDM solution specifically designed for macOS and iOS devices. It has a long history of providing in-depth management and customisation tailored to Apple products.

**Pros:**

1. **Apple-centric management:** JAMF Pro offers deep integration with macOS and iOS, providing extensive control over device configurations, updates, and security settings.
2. **User-friendly interface:** The management console is known for its intuitive design, making it easier for administrators to manage Apple devices efficiently.
3. **Customisable policies:** It provides advanced customisation options for creating and enforcing policies specific to macOS, such as detailed configuration profiles and custom scripts.
4. **Rich ecosystem:** JAMF has a robust ecosystem with many integrations and extensions, enhancing its functionality and flexibility.

**Cons:**

1. **Cost:** JAMF Pro can be pricey, which may be a consideration for smaller organisations or those with budget constraints.
2. **Apple-specific:** While it excels with Apple devices, it doesn’t offer cross-platform management, which could be a limitation if you need to manage a diverse range of devices.
3. **Complexity for new users:** For organisations not familiar with JAMF or those new to macOS management, there may be a learning curve.

**macOS SSO integration:**  
JAMF Pro does support macOS SSO, but the setup and integration might not be as seamless as with Intune, particularly if your organisation heavily utilises Microsoft services. JAMF Pro can manage SSO configurations, but it typically requires additional setup and might not provide the same level of integration with Microsoft’s ecosystem.

## Kandji

**Overview:**  
Kandji is a newer entrant into the macOS MDM space, offering a cloud-based solution designed to streamline macOS management with modern features and an emphasis on ease of use.

**Pros:**

1. **Modern UI:** Kandji is praised for its clean and modern user interface, which simplifies the management of macOS devices.
2. **Automation:** Kandji offers strong automation capabilities, such as auto-pilot setup and pre-configured blueprints, which can significantly reduce the time and effort required for device deployment and management.
3. **Security and compliance:** It provides robust security features and compliance tools, including automated patch management and continuous compliance monitoring.
4. **Integration:** Kandji integrates well with other tools and services, offering flexibility in a multi-tool environment.

**Cons:**

1. **Newer solution:** As a newer player in the MDM space, Kandji may not yet have the depth of features or extensive ecosystem that more established solutions like JAMF Pro offer.
2. **Cost:** Depending on the features and scale, Kandji can be relatively expensive, though it often presents a competitive alternative to traditional solutions.
3. **Limited non-Apple device support:** Similar to JAMF, Kandji focuses primarily on Apple devices, which may be a drawback for organisations needing cross-platform management.

**macOS SSO integration:**  
Kandji does support macOS SSO, but similar to JAMF, the integration might not be as tightly coupled with Microsoft services as it is with Intune. Organisations heavily invested in Microsoft infrastructure might find Intune’s SSO capabilities to be more integrated and streamlined.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right MDM solution for macOS depends on your organisation’s specific needs, existing infrastructure, and budget. Here’s a quick summary to guide your decision:

- **Microsoft Intune** is ideal for organisations already using Microsoft products and needing a unified management solution across multiple device types. Its seamless integration with macOS SSO is a significant advantage for those utilising Microsoft’s cloud services.
- **JAMF Pro** excels with its deep Apple-centric features and robust ecosystem but may be costlier and more complex. It supports macOS SSO but may not integrate as seamlessly with Microsoft services.
- **Kandji** offers a modern, user-friendly approach with strong automation and security features but may be less established and focused primarily on macOS. Its SSO integration is compatible but not as integrated with Microsoft’s ecosystem as Intune.

Evaluate each solution based on your organisational requirements, existing tech stack, and budget to determine which MDM solution aligns best with your macOS management needs and integration preferences.
