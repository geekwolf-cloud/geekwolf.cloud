## Introduction

In today’s cybersecurity landscape, strong password policies are crucial for protecting against unauthorised access and cyberattacks. Entra ID Password Protection extends Azure Active Directory's robust password security features to on-premises Active Directory environments. This integration helps organisations enforce consistent password policies across both cloud and on-premises systems. This blog provides a comprehensive overview of how Entra ID Password Protection works, including installation, configuration, communication protocols, and the caching mechanism used for enforcing password policies.

## Key components

Entra ID Password Protection involves several key components:

1. **Azure AD Password Protection Proxy Service**:
   - **Function**: Acts as a bridge between the on-premises environment and Azure AD, facilitating secure communication for password policies.
   - **Installation**: Installed on a Windows Server that can connect to both the domain controllers and Azure AD.

2. **Azure AD Password Protection DC Agent**:
   - **Function**: Enforces password policies on domain controllers by interacting with the Proxy Service.
   - **Installation**: Deployed on each domain controller in the AD forest.

3. **Azure AD Password Protection Policies**:
   - **Configuration**: Managed directly in the Azure AD portal. Policies include banned password lists, complexity requirements, and lockout thresholds.

## Installation and configuration

### Azure AD Password Protection Proxy Service

- **Installation**:
  - Install the Proxy Service on a member server in the on-premises environment.
  - Ensure the server has internet access for communication with Azure AD and is part of the AD forest.

- **Configuration**:
  - Register the Proxy Service with Azure AD using PowerShell commands.
  - The service retrieves password policy settings from Azure AD and distributes them to domain controllers.

### Azure AD Password Protection DC Agent

- **Installation**:
  - Install the DC Agent on each domain controller in your environment.
  - The installation can be automated using tools like Group Policy or SCCM.

- **Configuration**:
  - No additional configuration is required beyond the installation. The DC Agent starts enforcing policies as soon as it is installed and communicates with the Proxy Service for updates.

### Azure AD Password Protection Policies

- **Configuration**:
  - Access the Azure AD portal and navigate to **Security > Authentication methods > Password protection**.
  - Configure global settings, including custom banned password lists and lockout thresholds.

## Communication and protocols

### Communication between DC Agent and Proxy Service

- **Protocol**: Uses secure RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol.
- **Purpose**: The DC Agent queries the Proxy Service to retrieve and update password policy information.

### Communication between Proxy Service and Azure AD

- **Protocol**: HTTPS (port 443) for secure REST API calls.
- **Purpose**: The Proxy Service communicates with Azure AD to download the latest password protection policies.

## Caching mechanism

### Policy retrieval and caching

- **Initial retrieval**:
  - The Proxy Service periodically fetches the latest password policies from Azure AD.

- **Local caching**:
  - The DC Agent caches these policies locally on the domain controllers.
  - The cache includes the banned password list and policy settings such as complexity and lockout requirements.

- **Cache updates**:
  - The cache is updated at regular intervals, ensuring policies remain current but not requiring real-time queries to Azure AD.

### Password change/reset process

- **User initiates password change**:
  - Password changes or resets are initiated through standard AD mechanisms.

- **Policy enforcement**:
  - The DC Agent checks the proposed password against the cached policies.
  - If the password meets the requirements, the change or reset is allowed. If not, the password is rejected, and the user is prompted to choose a different one.

- **Logging**:
  - Domain controllers log password changes and policy enforcement actions for auditing purposes.

## Conclusion

Entra ID Password Protection integrates Azure AD’s password security capabilities with on-premises Active Directory environments, offering enhanced protection against weak and compromised passwords. By leveraging the Azure AD Password Protection Proxy Service and DC Agents, organisations can enforce consistent password policies across their IT infrastructure. The caching mechanism ensures efficient policy enforcement while minimising the need for real-time communication with Azure AD.

Implementing Entra ID Password Protection provides a robust defence against common password-based threats, safeguarding both cloud and on-premises environments from potential security breaches.
