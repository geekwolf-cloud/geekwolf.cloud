Transitioning from on-premises infrastructure to a cloud-native environment using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) and Microsoft 365 is a strategic move that can enhance security, improve scalability, and streamline IT management. However, this process can be complex, especially when it comes to moving users, applications, and Active Directory (AD) to the cloud.

In this blog, we'll guide you through three essential steps to simplify this migration: preparing and migrating users and workstations, moving applications to the cloud, and finally, decommissioning your on-premises AD. With the right approach and tools like [PowerSyncPro](https://powersyncpro.com), you can make this transition as smooth as possible. Note that we use 'easy' in a sarcastic way as this is of course not easy...

## Step 1: Remove all users (including workstation preparation and policy migration)

The first and most critical step in your migration is to prepare and move your users to Entra ID, ensuring that their workstations, settings, and policies are also ready for a cloud-first environment.

### Step 1a: Establish hybrid identity with Entra Connect

Before you can fully migrate users, it’s important to set up a hybrid identity solution using Entra Connect. This tool synchronises your on-premises AD with Entra ID, allowing for a phased transition where users can authenticate against the cloud while still utilising on-premises resources.

- **Configure hybrid identity:** Ensure that your on-premises identities are synchronised with Entra ID to enable seamless access to both cloud and on-premises resources during the transition.

### Step 1b: Prepare settings and policies in the cloud

Before moving users, you need to migrate your Group Policies (GPOs) and other settings to the cloud. Microsoft Intune and other Azure tools can replicate these policies, ensuring that device management, security settings, and compliance controls are maintained.

- **Migrate Group Policies:** Use Microsoft Intune to configure device policies that mirror your existing GPOs, ensuring consistent management across all devices.

### Step 1c: Ensure application compatibility

Before fully moving users, confirm that all necessary applications are usable by cloud identities. This may involve using tools like Azure Application Proxy for legacy applications that aren’t cloud-ready, ensuring they can be accessed securely by users through Entra ID.

- **Use Azure Application Proxy:** Securely provide access to on-premises applications for cloud identities, acting as a stepping stone until these applications can be fully migrated to the cloud.

### Step 1d: Migrate workstations with PowerSyncPro

Workstation migration is a crucial part of this process. [PowerSyncPro](https://powersyncpro.com) simplifies the transition by allowing you to migrate workstations in place, preserving user profiles, data, and settings. This approach reduces downtime and avoids the complexity of reconfiguring each workstation from scratch.

- **Seamless workstation transition:** With PowerSyncPro, migrate workstations to the cloud without wiping them clean, ensuring users experience minimal disruption.
  
- **Automate and streamline:** PowerSyncPro automates much of the migration process, integrating with Intune for ongoing device management once the workstations are cloud-managed.

### Step 1e: Migrate users to cloud-only accounts

Once the workstations are migrated and settings are in place, you can transition users to cloud-only accounts. This step involves removing their on-premises AD accounts and fully managing identity through Entra ID.

- **Cloud-only identity management:** Rely entirely on Entra ID for authentication and access control, ensuring that users are no longer dependent on the on-premises AD.

## Step 2: Remove all applications (migrate to cloud-native solutions)

With users and workstations now cloud-managed, the next step is to move your applications to the cloud, enhancing availability, scalability, and security.

### Step 2a: Assess and categorise applications

Begin by evaluating your current applications to determine their cloud readiness. Applications can be categorised as:

- **Cloud-native:** Applications that can be moved to the cloud with minimal or no changes.
- **Lift-and-shift:** Applications that require some adjustments but can be moved to the cloud relatively easily.
- **Re-architecting:** Applications that need significant modification to operate effectively in a cloud environment.

### Step 2b: Migrate cloud-ready applications

For applications that are cloud-native or suitable for a lift-and-shift approach, begin the migration process by moving them to Azure or another cloud platform. This will reduce your reliance on on-premises infrastructure.

- **Cloud migration:** Move applications to cloud platforms like Azure, ensuring they are fully integrated with Entra ID for identity and access management.

### Step 2c: Transition to cloud-first solutions

As you migrate applications, consider transitioning to cloud-first solutions available through Microsoft 365 or other cloud providers. This might involve replacing an on-premises CRM with Dynamics 365 or shifting file storage to SharePoint Online.

- **Adopt cloud-first solutions:** Gradually replace legacy applications with modern, cloud-based alternatives that offer better integration, security, and scalability.

## Step 3: Remove Active Directory (decommission on-premises AD)

The final step in your migration journey is to decommission your on-premises Active Directory, signifying the full transition to a cloud-native environment.

### Step 3a: Finalise and validate all migrations

Before decommissioning AD, ensure that all user accounts, workstations, and applications have been fully migrated and are functioning correctly in the cloud. Conduct thorough testing to validate that everything operates as expected.

- **Validation:** Confirm that all systems, applications, and user experiences are consistent and reliable in the cloud environment.

### Step 3b: Decommission Active Directory

Once you’ve validated that the cloud environment is fully operational, you can proceed to decommission your on-premises AD. This involves shutting down domain controllers, removing the AD schema, and updating your IT documentation to reflect the new cloud-native setup.

- **Decommissioning:** Safely shut down and remove on-premises AD components, fully transitioning to Entra ID and cloud-based management.

## Conclusion

Migrating from on-premises infrastructure to Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft 365 is a transformative process that requires careful planning and execution. By following these three steps—preparing and migrating users and workstations, moving applications, and decommissioning Active Directory—you can streamline operations, enhance security, and reduce costs.

PowerSyncPro plays a critical role in this process, particularly in simplifying the migration of workstations, ensuring a smooth and efficient transition to a cloud-managed environment. As you complete this journey, you'll find your organisation better equipped to leverage the full potential of cloud technologies, driving innovation and success in the digital age.
