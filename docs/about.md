<p>Welcome to GeekWolf! I’m a Microsoft veteran with a journey that began in the mid-1990s when I first qualified as an MCSE on Windows NT 4.0. Since then, I’ve kept my certifications up to date, evolving with the ever-changing landscape of technology.</p>

<p>Today, I specialise in Microsoft 365 and Azure, helping companies navigate the complexities of mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, particularly when it comes to combining or splitting tenants. I also assist those making the transition to Microsoft Cloud from other platforms. While my focus has shifted towards cloud solutions, I still handle on-premises tasks like Active Directory and Exchange On-Premises, though these are becoming less frequent.</p>

<p>GeekWolf was born out of my passion for technology and a nod to Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction.” In the movie, Harvey Keitel’s character, Winston Wolf, is called upon to solve difficult problems. Similarly, I tackle messy, complex, and intriguing challenges in the tech world, albeit with less bloodshed.</p>
