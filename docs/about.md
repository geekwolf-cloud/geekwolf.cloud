<p>GeekWolf was borne out of my passion for technology.  I am a self-confessed geek, with many years in the IT world, and the Wolf part comes from the Quentin Tarantino’s "Pulp Fiction".   In the movie, Harvey Keitel’s character, Winston Wolf, is called upon to solve difficult problems. Similarly, I tackle messy, complex, and intriguing challenges in the tech world, albeit with less bloodshed (for which my wife is grateful).</p>

<p>This site will discuss various aspect of the Microsoft stack with a bias towards the cloud services, but only because they are so much more prevalent nowadays.  A lot of the blogs will provide an overview of technologies, including comparisons, but there will definitely be blogs that go into a lot more technical details around exactly how something works, why it works and how to leverage certain features.   I write this blog on a part-time basis, but if you comment on a blog post I will endeavour to respond, and if you like you can always email me via twan (at) geekwolf.cloud</p>

<p>I’m a Microsoft veteran with a journey that began in 1991, when I came out of university and landed a programming job in a language called Gupta SQLWindows.  It was a 4GL language well ahead of its time, and that got me into SQL Server (at that time it was still co-owned by Sybase and Microsoft)   I slowly found servers to be pretty interesting, and after my stint on OS2, Novell Netware and token ring networks, I came across Windows NT Server...  I first qualified as an MCP in Windows 95 and SQL Server 6.0 in 1995, and then an MCSE on Windows NT 4.0 1998. Since then, I’ve kept my certifications up to date (albeit via the mildly annoying annual re-certification), and evolve with the ever-changing landscape of technology.  Today, I specialise in Microsoft 365 and Azure, helping companies navigate the complexities of mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, particularly when it comes to combining or splitting tenants. I also assist those making the transition to Microsoft Cloud from other platforms. While my focus has shifted towards cloud solutions, I still handle on-premises tasks like Active Directory and Exchange On-Premises, though these are becoming less frequent.</p>
