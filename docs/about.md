<p>GeekWolf was borne out of my passion for technology.  I am a self-confessed geek, with many years in the IT world, and the Wolf part comes from the Quentin Tarantino’s "Pulp Fiction".   In the movie, Harvey Keitel’s character, Winston Wolf, is called upon to solve difficult problems. Similarly, I tackle messy, complex, and intriguing challenges in the tech world, albeit with less bloodshed (for which my wife is grateful).</p>

<p>I’m a Microsoft veteran with a journey that began in the mid-1990s when I first qualified as an MCSE on Windows NT 4.0. Since then, I’ve kept my certifications up to date, evolving with the ever-changing landscape of technology.  Today, I specialise in Microsoft 365 and Azure, helping companies navigate the complexities of mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures, particularly when it comes to combining or splitting tenants. I also assist those making the transition to Microsoft Cloud from other platforms. While my focus has shifted towards cloud solutions, I still handle on-premises tasks like Active Directory and Exchange On-Premises, though these are becoming less frequent.</p>
