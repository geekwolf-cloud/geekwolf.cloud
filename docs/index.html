<h1>Welcome to the GeekWolf website</h1>
<p>
This site aims to give insights, best practices and tips & tricks into the Microsoft stack with a particular focus on Identity, although I will no doubt drift into Entra ID, On-Premises, Microsoft 365, Google and Azure.  Having been in the Microsoft stack for a long time and with a development background in my early years, you will see PowerShell, Graph and perhaps even some C# code.  I have collated the blogs into Categories <span class="desktop-only-inline">(which are shown in the menu on the left)</span><span class="mobile-only-inline">(which are shown in the hamburger menu above)</span> and Tags <span class="desktop-only-inline">(which are shown in the tag cloud in the bottom left)</span><span class="mobile-only-inline">(which are shown in the tag cloud at the bottom)</span> I hope you enjoy the site, please feel free to comment on any post.  If you want a regular update sent to you summarising the recently added posts, then please subscribe to the newsletter.
